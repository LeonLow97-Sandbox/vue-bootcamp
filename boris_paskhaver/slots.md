# Slots

- Props are used to pass data in various data types (boolean, strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc.) from parent to child components.
- On the other hand `slots` are used to pass HTML elements or content from the parent component to the child components.
- `slots` allow the parent component to inject content into designated areas (placeholders) of the child component's template.
- This enables us to create more dynamic and flexible components by customizing their content without the need to modify the child component itself.
- Both props and slots allow us to build reusable and composable (composable = building complex functionality by combining smaller, reusable and independent components together) components in application.
